# odin-recipes
First commit 07.08.2022

The current project is called recipes. It is the Odin Project tutorial on the HTML foundations. I demonstrate what I have learned in the course so far, such as setting up the boiler plate, organizing directory, using html attributes, setting up links, and working with text.
